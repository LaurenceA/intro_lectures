I advise that you start by installing Anaconda Python distribution https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/, which is available on all operating systems, and comes with all the major numerical programming libraries.

In addition, you need to install PyTorch,
```

```


#Install https://github.com/matplotlib/jupyter-matplotlib.git

conda install -c conda-forge ipympl

# If using the Notebook
conda install -c conda-forge widgetsnbextension

# If using JupyterLab
conda install nodejs
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
jupyter labextension install jupyter-matplotlib
